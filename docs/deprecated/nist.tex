%\paragraph{Reports on Computer Systems Technology}

The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at NIST promotes the
U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical leadership for
the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops
tests, test methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations,
and technical analyses to advance the development and productive use
of information technology (IT). ITL’s responsibilities include the
development of management, administrative, technical, and physical
standards and guidelines for the cost-effective security and privacy
of other than national security-related information in federal
information systems. This document reports on ITL’s research,
guidance, and outreach efforts in IT and its collaborative activities
with industry, government, and academic organizations.
