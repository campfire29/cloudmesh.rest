\section{Contributing}

We invite you to contribute to this paper and its discussion to
improve it. Improvements can be done with pull requests. We suggest
you do {\em small} individual changes to a single subsection and
object rather than large changes as this allows us to integrate the
changes individually and comment on your contribution via github. Once
contributed we will appropriately acknowledge you either as
contributor or author. Please discuss with us how we best acknowledge
you.


\subsection{Conversion to Word}

We found that it is most convenient to manage the draft document on
github. Currently the document is located at:

\begin{itemize}
\item \url{https://github.com/cloudmesh/cloudmesh.rest/tree/master/docs}
\end{itemize}

Managing the document in github has provided us with the advantage that a
reference implementation can be automatically derived from the
specified objects. Also it is easy to contribute as all text is
written in ASCII while using \LaTeX syntax to allow for formating in
PDF. 

Contributions can be mades as follows:

\begin{description}
\item[Contributions with git pull requests]: You can fork the
  repository, make modifications and create a pull request that we
  than review and integrate
\item[Contribution with direct access]: Cloudmesh.rest developers have
  direct access to the repository. If you are a frequent contributor
  to the document and are familiar with github we can grant you
  access. However, we do prefer pull requests as this minimizes our
  administrative overhead to avoid issues with git
\item[Contributing ASCII sections with git issues]: You can identify
  the version of the document, specify the section and line numbers
  you want to modify and include the new text. We will integrate and
  address these issues ASAP. Issues can be submitted at 
  \url{https://github.com/cloudmesh/cloudmesh.rest/issues}
\end{description}


\subsection{Object Specification}

All objects are located in 

\begin{verbatim}
cloudmesh.rest/cloudmesh/specification/examples
\end{verbatim}

And can be modified there

\subsection{Creation of the PDF document}

We assume that you have LaTeX installed. Latex can be trivially
installed on Windows, OSX, and Linux. Please refer to the instalation
instructions for your OS. If you have Windows and have not make installed, you can
obtain it from \url{http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm}
Please google for it and find the version most suitable for you.

Firts you have to obtain the document from github.com. Currently, you
can do this with 

\begin{verbatim}
   git clone https://github.com/cloudmesh/cloudmesh.rest
\end{verbatim}

To compile the document please use 

\begin{verbatim}
   cd docs
   make
\end{verbatim}

This will generate the PDF file 

\begin{verbatim}
   NIST.SP.1500-8-draft.pdf
\end{verbatim}

On OSX we have also integrated a quick view whit 

\begin{verbatim}
   make view
\end{verbatim}

The PDF document can be transfered to doc and docx, with the following
online tool:

* \url{http://pdf2docx.com/}

We noticed that some tabs in the object definitions may get lost, but
they can be integrated easily. If yo notice any other formatting
issues, please file an issue.

We assume that those writeing the document in word use a simple style
theme using regular styles. Once the NIST editors have provided a
suitable style them we will upload it to the repository so it can be
applied easily.

\subsection{Code Generation}

This section is intended for experts and guidance on using it can be
obtained by contacting Gregor von Laszewski. It is assumed that you
have installed all the tools. To create the document you can simply do

\begin{Verbatim}
git clone https://github.com/cloudmesh/cloudmesh.rest
python setup.py install; pip install .
cd cloudmesh.rest
cd docs
make schema
make
\end{Verbatim}

This will produce in that directory a file called object.pdf
containing this document.
