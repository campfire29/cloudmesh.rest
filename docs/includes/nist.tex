NIST Special Publication series 1500 is intended to capture external
perspectives related to NIST standards, measurement, and
testing-related efforts. These external perspectives can come from
industry, academia, government, and others. These reports are intended
to document external perspectives and do not represent official NIST
positions.

  Certain commercial entities, equipment, or materials may be
  identified in this document in order to describe an experimental
  procedure or concept adequately. Such identification is not intended
  to imply recommendation or endorsement by NIST, nor is it intended
  to imply that the entities, materials, or equipment are necessarily
  the best available for the purpose.

  There may be references in this publication to other publications
  currently under development by NIST in accordance with its assigned
  statutory responsibilities. The information in this publication,
  including concepts and methodologies, may be used by federal
  agencies even before the completion of such companion
  publications. Thus, until each publication is completed, current
  requirements, guidelines, and procedures, where they exist, remain
  operative. For planning and transition purposes, federal agencies
  may wish to closely follow the development of these new publications
  by NIST.

  Organizations are encouraged to review all draft publications during
  public comment periods and provide feedback
  to NIST. All NIST publications are available at \\

%\paragraph{Reports on Computer Systems Technology}

The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at NIST promotes the
U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical leadership for
the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops
tests, test methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations,
and technical analyses to advance the development and productive use
of information technology (IT). ITL’s responsibilities include the
development of management, administrative, technical, and physical
standards and guidelines for the cost-effective security and privacy
of other than national security-related information in federal
information systems. This document reports on ITL’s research,
guidance, and outreach efforts in IT and its collaborative activities
with industry, government, and academic organizations.
